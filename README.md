# PHP PDO Intro

**Description:**

A practice example for PHP PDO connections and querying a MySQL database with prepared statements. 

Use this code example to create your own PHP application that connects to MySQL and queries data from a table.

This example uses the freely available for download "world" database. You will need to download and import it into your MySQL server. You can download the "world" database and other free databases [here](https://blog.sqlauthority.com/2020/02/15/mysql-download-sample-database-sakila-world-employee/).

This tutorial uses a PHP Data Object (PDO), but it is NOT an example of an OOP application. It is a simple application example.
